# Horiseon Marketing Website Task

The task at hand was to ensure that the codebase for my clients' website followed all accessibility standards and that it was optimized for search engines. In doing this, the website will perform better and rank accurately in search engine algorithms thus; improving searchability and allowing them to reach the best-matched clientele for their services. 
Given that Horiseon is a marketing company, that prides itself on SEO and marketing consulting services, I really wanted to get into the challenge of ensuring that this is enhanced by making sure that their codebase meets ranked well online. I did this by making sure that I used descriptive wording in the code for images, having the title of their page coincide with their company name. I also made sure that missing links for the page were correctly linked so that they could be responsive in the production environment, as the client could potentially miss out on clientele due to not having working links to topics that they need more information on.

Having a codebase that has descriptive wording for imagery, means that it also meets important accessibility standards. For example, if a person who is vision impaired needs extra context for images, their accessibility settings will be able to have these descriptions read out loud for them without missing any context.
